## Type of network protocol
1. Network-attached storage (NAS)
Think of NAS like a special box where you can store all your toys (files) and share them with your friends (computers) over your home Wi-Fi (network). Instead of keeping your toys in one room, you put them in this box, and anyone in the house can easily access them.

2. Storage Area Network (SAN)
A SAN is like a super fast and big playground specifically built for storing and playing with toys. Instead of just sharing a few toys, it connects many toy boxes (storage devices) together and makes it easy to manage and access them very quickly. It’s like having a special highway for your toys.

3. Network File System (NFS)
NFS is like a rule book that tells how to share toys (files) over the network so that different friends (computers) can play with the toys as if they were in their own room. It’s a way for friends to agree on how to borrow and use each other’s toys.

4. File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
FTP is like having a delivery service that helps you send and receive toys (files) from one place to another over the internet. Imagine you want to send a toy to a friend in another house; FTP is like the postman that takes the toy and delivers it to your friend.

5. Server Message Block (SMB)
SMB is like having a special set of rules that allows friends (computers) in a neighborhood (network) to share toys (files) and tools (printers) easily. It’s like having a neighborhood library where everyone can borrow and return books (files) and use the library's printer.

6. Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)
iSCSI is like a magic tunnel that connects your toy box (storage) directly to your computer over the internet. It makes your computer think the toy box is just an extension of its own storage space, even though it’s far away. It’s like having a long arm that can reach out and grab toys from a distant shelf.
